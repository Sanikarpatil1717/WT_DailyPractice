Code Quality Standards
1. Class/ Enum name should always start with Capital letters
2. Method and variable names should always start with small letters.
3. For more the 1 word in a name use "camelCasing".
4. Package names must all in small letters. For more than one word no underscores or camelCasing should be used, write it as one complete word.
5. While declaring constants use all capital letters. For more than one word name use underscore for separation.
6. All the variables declared in Enums are final constants, therefore they should be written in all capital letters.

JDK (Compiles / gives output as .class file) vs JRE (runs .class files)

Path (always a path to executable files) vs ClassPath (path to .class files for collection of .class files i.e .jar files)

* Pure Class is a class which has all the variables as private and methods as public.

Data types

Constants : final
Variables :
	Primitive :
		Numeric :
			Whole : byte(1), short(2), int(4), long(8)
		Real : float(4), double(8)
		Non-numeric :
			char(2) (C/ C++ uses ASCII format so they use 1 byte per character, while JAVA uses Unicode character that's why it uses 2 bytes per character)
			boolean(1)
	Non-Primitive : 
		Arrays, Any Class, Interface, Enums


(There is no "short int" , "long int" in java)
(There is no "unsigned" keyword in java)

Control Statements : 
	Conditional : if, if-else, if-else-if, nested-if, switch
	Looping/ Repetitional/ Iterative : for, while, do-while
	Branching/ Jumping : break, continue, return


Operators
1. Unary
2. Binary
3. Ternary

a. Arithmetic	: +, -, *, /, %
b. Logical	: &&, ||, !
c. Bitwise	: &, |, ^
d, Relational	: <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
e. Inc/Decr	: ++, --
d. Shift	: >>, << (shift is performed without shifting sign bit), >>> (sign bit is also shifted)
e. Assignment	: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
d. Conditional	: res = (a>b) ? a (true) : b (false)
